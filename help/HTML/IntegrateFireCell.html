<H1>Integrate and Fire Cell</H1>
<P>Our spiking cells are all based on a simple integrate 
and fire (IF) neuron. The cell has an internal state--its membrane potential--which integrates the cell's input 
over time. The input can be either excitatory (increases the 
potential)&nbsp;or inhibitory (decreases the potential). The integration is leaky: If an input dumps 
some "charge" onto the membrane, thcharge will leak away after a second or so. If 
the membrane potential crosses the threshold, a spike is emitted and the 
membrane is reset to the resting level. The membrane potential is clamped by the 
spike threshold on the positive side, and by a negative limit on the other 
side.</P>

     <BR><BR>This IF model is about as simple 
as you can get. It does not simulate the many currents present during 
real spikes. It neglects many interesting and probably important aspects of real 
spike generation mechanisms, including the very perceivable spike rate 
adaptation mechanisms that act like high-pass filters in the spike rate domain. 
These in reality prevent sustained bursts at high spike rates, which would make 
it difficult to apply DC stimuli to real cells and hear any perceivable 
response. That's why neurophysiologists rarely apply static stimuli--the 
responses are very small.<BR><BR></P>
