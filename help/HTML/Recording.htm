<H1>Recording</H1>
<P>The Record menu lets you mark positions on the tangent 
sceen or record from the simulation 
or from the microphone input.</P>
<H2>Marking the tangent screen</H2>
<P><IMG height=530 hspace=0 src="../Images/marker.gif" width=671 border=0></P>
<P>The <A href="Hot_Keys.htm">hot key</A> 
<STRONG>M</STRONG> will draw the outline of the present stimulus on the tangent 
screen. Each <STRONG>M</STRONG> will add a new outline.&nbsp; You can see how 
this is used above to determine the center of the receptive field. The hot key 
<STRONG>C</STRONG>               
                
    will clear the marks.</P>
<H2>Recording spikes</H2>
<P>          
     The recordings are displayed as spike-triggered 
stimuli. Each spike triggers the display of the stimulus at the time of the 
spike. This is called <EM>spike-triggered averaging</EM> if it is done over a large 
number of stimuli.</P>

  <LI>Enable recording - turns recording on and off 
  <LI>Clear - clears recorded spike-triggered stimuli 
  <LI>Set spike persistence - sets the number of spikes to 
  remember 
  <LI>Fade spike-triggered stimuli - fades older 
  spike-triggered stimuli to the background color 
  <LI>Fill in spike-triggered stimuli - fills in the spike triggered stimuli 
  instead of displaying them as outlines.</LI></UL>
<P>Recorded spikes are displayed with outlined stimuli on the tangent screen, 
providing a very simple spike-triggered average of the stimuli that cause 
responses.</P>

<H3>Microphone recording</H3>
<P>The microphone recording option is for use with the <A 
href="http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~tobi/friend/chip">Physiologist's Friend 
Chip</A>. You can plug in any analog 
source to the microphone or just record from the built in microphone on your 
computer. Each time the input rises above a threshold (hard coded) the program 
records a spike. The input must drop below the threshold minus a hystersis 
before a new spike can be detected -- this hystersis tries to avoid triggering 
multiple spikes on a noisy input. This recording method is best suited to 
digital inputs that are at least 1/4000 second wide.</P>
