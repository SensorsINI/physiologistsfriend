<P>In this simulation, the horizontal 
cell simply averages all the <A 
href="Photoreceptor.html">photoreceptor</A> outputs. It establishes spatial 
context to which the <A href="BipolarCell.html">bipolar </A>        
           
cells can use to compare the outputs of the photoreceptors.<BR><BR>In 
addition, the horizontal cell does a <A href="LowPass_Filter.htm">low-pass</A> termporal filtering. &nbsp;You 
can see this if you suddenly apply a wide field <A 
href="Stimulus.htm">stimulus</A>  
            
       to the entire photoreceptor array. You will 
see that the horizontal cell takes some time to respond.<BR><BR>Real horizontal 
cells form a lateral mesh of cells underlying the photoreceptors. These 
horizontal cells are laterally coupled by ohmic junctions, so the horizontal 
cells form a true resistive, or spreading, network.<BR><BR>We only modeled a 
single horizontal cell because the computation of a true spreading network is 
expensive, and would not buy us much for such a small spatial 
extent.<BR><BR></P>
