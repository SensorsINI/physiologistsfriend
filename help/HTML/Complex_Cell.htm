<H1>Complex Cell</H1>
<P>This class of cell seems to care about orientation but not much else. These 
cells act like they are somehow or-ing together a bunch of simple cells, all 
sharing the same orientation, but differing in spatial position, phase, and 
symmetry. In contrast to simple cells, their response is not linear in the size 
of the preferred stimulus. They seem to respond equally well to a stimulus with 
the preferred orientation no matter what its size of polarity, and not matter 
where the stimulus is located in the receptive field.</P>
<P>In our program, we modeled a complex cell by summing 
together the outputs from two odd <A href="Simple_Cell.htm">simple cells</A>             
     at the same location but with opposite polarity. You 
can see how this results in a cell that responds optimally to this 
orientation.</P>
