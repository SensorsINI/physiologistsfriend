<H1>Direction Selective Simple Cell</H1>
<P>A direction selective cell responds differently depending on the direction of 
motion of the stimulus. Many, if not most, visual cells in the cortex are 
direction selective, although for simplicity we have only supplied you with a 
single example in our simulation.</P>
<P>Our direction-selective model is a Barlow-Levick null-inhibition type of 
model. Two <EM>odd-</EM>type simple cells drive the direction-selective (<FONT 
color=#8080ff>DS</FONT>) simple cell. One excites the DS cell, the other 
inhibits it. The inhibitory input is spatially offset. When the stimulus comes 
from this null direction, the DS cell is inhibited by the excitation of the non 
DS simple cell. When the stimulus comes from the preferred direction, the DS 
cell responds because the inhibitory input to the DS cell has not yet been 
excited. The inhibitory input to the DS cell lasts longer because it is more 
lowpass filtered.</P>
<P>Real direction selective simple cells are thought by some people to arise 
from a correlation-type mechanism. The DS cell correlates a direct input with a 
delayed, spatially offset input. In addition, DS cells combine inputs of various 
phases and symmetries to result in a realistic response. People are still 
arguing about the mechanism of direction selectivity in early visual cortex, and 
the mechanism that results in the very long delays that seem to be necessary to 
explain direction selectivity for very small speeds.are not yet 
understood.</P>
