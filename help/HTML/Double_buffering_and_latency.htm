<H2>  Double buffering</H2>
<P>Since this is a simulation on a serial machine, the cells 
can only be updated sequentially. We use a standard technique for avoiding weird 
effects due to the possible ordering up the updates of the states of the 
simulation components (the cells) by <EM>double-buffering</EM> the cells. That 
means that at each time step, the cells inputs come from the outputs of the 
cells at the previous time step. The new outputs of all the cells are computed 
but are not used until after all the cells' new states are computed. Then, in a 
separate iteration over all the cells, all the cells output are updated to the 
ones that were just computed.</P>
<H2>Latency</H2>
<P>This double-buffering means that any changes need to be propogated through 
all levels of the simulation. A change to the stimulus will appear at the output 
of a photoreceptor after one simulation cycle, but will only appear at a 
cortical cell after approximately 5 cycles. </P>

    Simulation Properties </H2>
<P>You can set the delay of the the simulation thread 
between iterations, and the number of complete iterations over all the cells 
during each simulation step using the <EM>Simulation/Properties...</EM>           
               
             
     dialog. </P>
<P>           
  A short delay will cause more simulation steps to be computed per unit 
real time. A large number of iterations will cause signals to propogate through 
the layers of cells more quickly. </P>
<P>       The peak spike rate 
is determined by the simulation delay, because at most a single spike can be emitted 
during each simulation step. If you set the delay to 100ms, the maximum 
spike rate is limited to 10Hz. </P>
