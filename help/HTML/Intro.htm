<H1>The Physiologist's Friend Simulator</H1>
<DIV class=Section1>
<P><B>PhysioFriend</B> lets you plot 
receptive fields of simulated retinal and cortical cells, both for <A 
href="Luminance_and_Color_Simulations.htm">the luminance and color systems</A>    
   . It models a small patch          
           
              
            
              
   of the retina and (for the luminance simulation) a part of a 
single cortical column. It is intended for classroom demonstration of cell response properties 
or for teaching yourself something about the responses of visual 
cells. </P>
<P>    
            
      You can hear the cell 
responses as though you were doing a recording from a live animal. You can 
choose between <A href="Photoreceptor.html">photoreceptor</A>, <A 
href="HorizontalCell.html">horizontal cell</A>, on and off <A 
href="BipolarCell.html">bipolar cells</A>, on and off <A 
href="GanglionCell.html">ganglion cells</A>, and several types of <A 
href="Early_Visual_Cortex.htm">cortical cells</A>. You can use bar, edge, or 
grating <A href="Stimulus.htm">stimuli</A> . You will hear how the cell responds 
as you use your mouse to move the stimulus around the virtual tangent screen. 
The stimulus orientation, contrast, size, spatial frequency can be easily <A 
href="Stimulus.htm">manipulated through the keyboard</A>          
           
              
            
              
               
             
          
. </P>
<P>PhysioFriend is 100% written in <A href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</A>  
.&nbsp; You need a Java run time environment (at least version 1.4+) and a sound 
card--if you want to hear the cells. (If you don't have a sound card, you can 
still see the cells responses on an activity meter.) </P>
