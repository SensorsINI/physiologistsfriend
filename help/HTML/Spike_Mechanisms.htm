<H1>Spike Mechanisms</H1>
<P>In simulations, the level of detail at which spike 
mechanisms are simulated can vary greatly. You could choose to simulate a 
complex conductance-bsased model like&nbsp;the famous&nbsp;Hodgkin-Huxley sodium-potassium mechanism, 
or you could emit spikes randomly at a mean rate proportional to the input.</P>
<P>            
            
         
         In this program, we use 
mostly a simplified <A href="IntegrateFireCell.html" >Integrate-and-File 
(IF)</A>             
   mechanism. We may also be using a Poisson spike rate mechanism.</P>
<P>            In 
either case, the results are spike events that you can hear on the speaker.</P>
<H2>Spike rate encoding</H2>
<P>Because the number of cells is so small, the cell 
outputs are not taken to be the actual spikes, but rather the instantaneous 
spike rate.</P>
<P>                
         This spike rate is 
the reciprocal of the time between the last two spikes, <A 
href="LowPass_Filter.htm">lowpass filtered </A>with some time constant 
of about 100ms. It is this value that you can observe in the <A 
href="Quick_Start.htm#activity">activity bar</A>    
              
.</P>
