<P>A lowpass filter smooths its input over time. The filter is characterized 
only by its time constant. Each new sample is combined with the previous output 
of the filter as follows</P>
<P>New Output = Old Output + dt/tau * ( Input - Old Output)</P>
<P>where dt is the time since the last sample, and tau is 
the time constant of the filter. You can see that the output approaches the input monotonically, at a rate inversely proportional to the 
time constant.</P>
