</H1>
<P><B>PhysioFriend</B> lets you plot receptive fields of simulated retinal and 
cortical cells. It is intended for classroom demonstration of cell response 
properties. You can hear the cell responses as though you were doing a recording 
from a live animal. You can choose between photoreceptor, horizontal cell, on 
and off bipolar cells, on and off ganglion cells, and several types of cortical 
cells. You can use bar, edge, or grating stimuli. You will hear how the cell 
responds as you use your mouse to move the stimulus. The stimulus orientation, 
contrast, size, spatial frequency can be easily manipulated through the 
keyboard. </P>
<P>PhysioFriend is 100% written in <A href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</A>. All 
you need is the Java run time environment (at least version 1.3+) and a sound 
card--if you want to hear the cells. (If you don't have a sound card, you can 
still see the cells responses on an activity meter.) </P>
<H2>Requirements: </H2><B>Apple's Java Runtime Environent is apparently far 
behind other releases. PhysioFriend does not seem to run well, even under the 
JRE 1.3.1 that ships with OS10.2. The components of PhysioFriend show up very 
strangely and response is extremely slow. For the moment, it looks like you 
cannot run PhysioFriend on Macs. </B>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://java.sun.com/downloads/index.html">Java Run Time 
  Environment</A> (JRE) version 1.3+. Available for Windows, Linux, Macintosh 
  and other platforms. As of right now, Apple's OS 10.1 comes with Java 
  installed, but only version 1.3. If you are on another platform you will 
  probably need to install the JRE if you have not done so already. 
  <LI>Java compatible sound card. Java seems to know about most sound cards.

<H2>Downloading, installing, and running PhysioFriend: </H2>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="onestep.html">Download, install and 
  run Java, Java Web Start, and PhysioFriend in one step</A> if you're running 
  Internet Explorer 5+ or Netscape 4.x.</A>. </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="friend.jnlp">Download and launch the 
  latest version of PhysioFriend</A> in one step if you have <A   href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java Web Start</A> 

  installed. 
  <UL>
    <LI>Java Web Start does the download, install, and launch in one step, and 
    it keeps you automatically up-to-date with the latest version of 
    PhysioFriend. Java Web Start comes by default in Mac OS 10.1. For other 
    platforms, it is installed by default in Java 1.4.1+, and is available as a 
    separate download for other Java versions. 
    <LI>If you have Java installed, you may not have Java Web Start as well, so 
    you may need to install the updater to get Web Start. 
    <LI>Under <B>linux</B>, installing the Java RPM does not install Java Web 
    Start. You still need to go the Java installation directory (typically 
    something like </I>/usr/java/j2re1.4.1</I>) and then unzip the Java Web 
    Start archive and run a separate installer script to get Web Start. 
    <LI>If you're having trouble with getting <A     href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</A> to recognize the <I>jnlp</I> 

    type, you may need to install <A     href="http://nsdl.sdsc.edu/apps/MozillaWS_help.html">Java Web Start as a 

    helper application to use with files with the <I>.jnlp</I> extension</A>. 
    </LI></UL>
  <LI>For <B>Windows</B>, you can <A href="Setup.exe">download a Windows installer</A>. Run 
  <I>Setup.exe</I> to install PhysioFriend along with Start Menu and Desktop 
  shortcuts. 
  <LI>For <B>other platforms</B> without Java Web Start but with the JRE (1.3+) 
  installed, download <A href="friend.jar">friend.jar</A>. From the command line, PhysioFriend 
  can be started with <BR><I>java -jar friend.jar</I> </LI></UL>

  <LI>You won't hear anything because the photoreceptor is not a spiking cell, 
  but you can observe the response of the photoreceptor on the activity bar on 
  the right. 
  <LI>To get help on the keyboard shortcuts, use the Help menu or hit F1. 
  <LI>To select the cell you want to observe, use the Cell menu. 
  <LI>If the cell is a spiking cell, you will hear its spikes and you can see 
  the spike rate on the activity meter. If the cell is a graded cell you will 
  only see the response on the activity meter. 
  <LI>To select the stimulus you want to use, use the Stimulus menu. 
  <LI>To view the photoreceptor locations, select View.../Photoreceptors 
  <LI>Explore the menus and try the popup menu on the tangent screen. There are 
  many keyboard shortcuts that you can pick up from the menus or from the Hot 
  Key help. </LI></UL>
<H2>How it works </H2>
<P>PhysioFriend does a relatively simple-minded simulation of the cells. The 
intention is not to simulate the beautiful complexity of the visual system, but 
just to capture some aspects of how the cells seem to respond. These cell 
responses should pass the Turing test—they should behave and sound like real 
cells. </P>
<H2>Version information </H2>
<P><I>If you use Java Web Start, you will always be up-to-date with the latest 
version.</I> </P>
