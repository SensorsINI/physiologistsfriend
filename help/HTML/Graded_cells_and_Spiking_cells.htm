<H1>Graded cells and Spiking cells</H1>
<P>       Some 
cells, particularly in the retina, are graded cells. When you monitor a graded 
cell, you will not hear anything because the cells do not spike.</P>
<P>        
Graded cells communicate only over short distances and do not require a spike 
mechanism. They synapse to other cells either by a number of mechanisms:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Chemical synapses that continually release neurotransmitter-containing 
  vesicles depending on the membrane potential. Chemical synapses synapse 
  between <A href="Photoreceptor.html">photoreceptors</A> and <A 
  href="BipolarCell.html">bipolar cells</A>, for example. 
  <LI>Gap junctions. These are ohmic connections that connect the cells' 
  membrane potentials directly. <A href="HorizontalCell.html">Horizontal 
  cells</A> are connected to each other by gap junctions, so they form a 
  continuous resistive sheet.</LI></OL>
