<P>The photoreceptor is the first stage of processing in the 
retina. A photoreceptor responds to the brightness at a certain location on the 
screen. It has a steady-state (DC) response and a transient response. The gain 
of the transient response is higher than that of the steady state response by a 
factor of 2 or 3. The transient response adapts away after a second or 
so.<BR><BR>In this simulation we have not 
modeled the amazing gain-control of real photoreceptors that let them function 
over many decades of illumination. (There's no need for this in the controlled 
environment of a virtual tangent screen). We have also not modeled the known 
feedback from the horizontal cells to the photoreceptor, via the interesting 
triad synapse. However, we have modeled the photoreceptor's temporal adapatation 
properties using a <A href="HighPass_Filter.htm">linear highpass filter</A>. The 
photoreceptors response is the sum</P>

       ACGain*Highpass(input)+DCGain*input<BR><BR>We can compute the photoreceptor response to the simple 
stimuli you can use in the simulation because people have developed very fast 
algorithms for computing the intersections of convex polygons. If we needed to 
do a general convolution of the shape of the photoreceptor and an arbitrary 
stimulu,s the simulation would probably not run in real time. These polygon 
intersections are shown in the output from one of the test classes below.</P>
