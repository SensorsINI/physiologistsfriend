Graphics objects and interfaces.
The heart of the <CODE>graphics</CODE> package are the interfaces {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.Transformable}
and {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.Intersectable}. <CODE>Transformable</CODE> means that the object can be transformed
by a number of methods, and <CODE>Intersectable</CODE> means that the object's area can be computed and its intersection shape with
other <CODE>Intersectable</CODE> can be obtained.
<p>
The transformations that can be applied are buffered  -- each of the possible
transforms (rotations, scaling, and translation} are separately buffered and each can be manipulated.
The possible transformations are specified by the interface {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.SeparateTransforms}.
Another interface, {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.BufferedTransform}, specifies how the resulting 
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.Transformable} can be obtained with the transforms applied.


<p>
The basic shape is a {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.ConvexPolygon}, which is a <CODE>Transformable</CODE> that inherits its
transformation methods from {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.AbstractTransformable}.
A {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.ShapeList} is a collection of <CODE>Transformable</CODE> that can be transformed as a whole.

<p>
The basic transform is {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.ConcreteSeparateTransforms}, which implements 
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.SeparateTransforms}.
<p>
The relation between a shape like a <CODE>ConvexPolygon</CODE> and its <CODE>SeparateTransforms</CODE> should be kept clear.
The transforms are constructed from a shape. This lets the transforms implement {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.BufferedTransform#getTransformed} 
so that you can obtain the transformed shape.
<p>
The relation between buffered transforms and transformations should also be kept clear.
A {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.Transformable} can be transformed, and a {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.graphics.SeparateTransforms} can have
its component transformations individually set.
