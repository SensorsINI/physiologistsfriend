  Spike recording using the microphone input with {@link
ch.unizh.ini.friend.record.SpikeReporter} and {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.record.SpikeEvent} generation
from these spikes. You can plug a <a
href="http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~tobi/chip">Physiologist's Friend chip</a> into
the microphone input of your computer and record its spikes using a {@link
ch.unizh.ini.friend.record.SpikeLogger}. Or you can use PhysioFriend to record the spikes directly and plot
marks on the tangent screen every time there is a spike.
