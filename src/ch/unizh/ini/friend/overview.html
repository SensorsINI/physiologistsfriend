  The Physiologist's Friend simulation. 
This program simulates a small patch of the retina and a few cortical cells. It lets you hear and see the responses of cells as you stimulate
them on a virtual tangent screen, in much the same way as physiologists do when they do experiments on live animals.
As you move the stimulus around using your mouse, you can see and hear the response of your chosen cell.  You can choose between retinal
cells like photoreceptors, horizontal cells, on and off bipolar cells, on and off ganglion cells, and several varieties of cortical cells.
You can observe properties like adaptation, lateral inhibition, and rectification into on and off channels. For cortical cells, you can
observe orientation preference and experience the difference between simple and complex-type responses.
