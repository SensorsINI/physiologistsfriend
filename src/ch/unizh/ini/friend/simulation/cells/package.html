This package contains specific cell types, which are subclasses of {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.AbstractCell}.
A cell usually references a collection of input cells or, more general, implementors of
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.ServesOutput} (AbstractCell implements ServesOutput).
The {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.Photoreceptor} is special in that it takes a 
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.stimulus.Stimulus} as its input. The photoreceptor can then ask what is its
excitation based on its shape. A cell provides its output through the ServesOutput interface to other cells.
<p>
In the context of the simulation, cells are the components that are simulated. The simulation requires its
components to implement {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.Updateable}, which provides the simulation
thread with the methods <code>compute(float dt)</code> and <code>update()</code>. The cell recomputes its
state on <code>compute(float dt)</code> but makes its new output available to other cells only on
<code>update()</code>. Inheriting the default implementations for this 'double-buffering' from
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.AbstractCell}, a cell only needs to implement its own
computations in <code>compute(float dt)</code> and at the end of that method assign its new output
to the field <code>newValue</code>.
<p>
There are currently two types of cells: the first type implements {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.GradedCell}
and its output is its analog signal response; the second type implements
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.SpikingCell} and its output is its spiking rate.
Current implementors of GradedCell are: {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.Photoreceptor},
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.HorizontalCell} and
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.BipolarCell}.
Current implementors of SpikingCell are: {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.AbstractSpikingCell} and
its descendants {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.IntegrateFireCell},
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.GanglionCell} and
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.PoissonSoma}.
<p>
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.AbstractSpikingCell} provides a few factory methods to construct 
cortical cells, namely:
Odd and even simple cells, which are (paradoxically) the most complicated cells to build, because they have
push-pull input from sets of retinal ganglion cells;
Complex cells and direction selective simple cells, which use simple combinations of basic simple cells
(note how they construct and add simple cells to the simulation for their own use).

<p>
All of these cells are instantiated in {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationSetupFactory}.
