This package contains specific synapse types, which are subclasses of
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.synapses.AbstractSynapse}.
A synapse references one or more input cells or, more general, implementors of
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.ServesOutput} (AbstractSynapse implements ServesOutput)
A synapse provides its output through the ServesOutput interface to the cell it corresponds to.
<p>
There is currently only one concrete class {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.synapses.ScalingSynapse}
in this package, which basically multiplies its input with a scalar (or weight) and makes the result
available to its cell.
<p>
It is noteworthy that the concept of a dendrite would software-technically and in this framework be the same as
as that of a synapse. The computation of both has to be done exactly once per simulation step and they
therefore do not have to provide any means of double-buffering or even simple buffering of their output.
It suffices for both to 'have' inputs and an output, where the computation of the output is done when the cell
requests it.
<p>
Synapses are instantiated in {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationSetupFactory} and other factory methods.
