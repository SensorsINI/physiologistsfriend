Code that simulates the cells.
The simulation is constructed by the factory method {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationSetupFactory#getSimulationSetup}.
It returns a {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationSetup} that affords access to some of the cells.
<p>
The simulation is updated by a particular {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationTask}. This task is hard-coded to be
either a {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.ThreadedSimulation} or a {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.TimedSimulation} by
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationSetupFactory}. The <CODE>SimulationTask</CODE> simply loops over the 
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationStep}. This <CODE>SimulationStep</CODE> first computes all the cell responses
at the present time step, and then updates the output values of all the cells based on what happened during that time step.

<p>
All objects (cells and monitors) that need to be 
processed for a simulation have the interface {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.Updateable}, which affords
a double-buffering of the simulation by separating the {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.Updateable#compute computation} and 
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.Updateable#update double-buffering} of the states of all the components.
<p>
This double-buffering means that the latency is linear in the number of stages of processing.
An excitation of a photoreceptor will only reach a cortical simple cell output after the information has flowed through the
photoreceptor, bipolar, ganglion, and simple cell ouptuts -- at least 4 simulation update cycles.
<p>
The number of simulation iterations over the population of updateables is
controlled by {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimulationStep#nIterate}.
This parameter can be set to >1 to iterate over all the cells multiple times for
each simulation. Setting this >1 will propogate signals through the network more
quickly, although the dynamics will not be changed because each simulation step
uses the real time as measured by System.currentTimeMillis().
<p>
Cells in the simulation are either constructed by one-to-one correspondence with a preceeding layer by static methods
(e.g., {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.AbstractAcceptsInput#connectOneToOne},
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.BipolarCell#getArrayListInstance}) or by specific assignment of inputs.
Inputs to cells usually implement {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.ServesOutput}, the most common
inputs are cells and synapses (e.g., descendants of {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.cells.AbstractCell},
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.synapses.AbstractSynapse}).

<p>
Simulation monitoring by the GUI is possible by means of monitors (objects that usually implement
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.AbstractMonitor}).
This class implements {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.Updateable}, so concrete descendants
can be added to the simulation to monitor a particular cell.
An example is {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.SimpleOutputMonitor}, which is used by the GUI
to put the activity of a selected cell on the {@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.gui.ActivityMeter}.
{@link ch.unizh.ini.friend.simulation.AudioOutput} renders its input cell audibly.
